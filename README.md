Proto14 is a fork of Scaxe-Legacy (which was itself a fork of NostalgiaCore, based on PocketMine-MP 1.3.12), featuring new content additions and bug fixes. This server software is designed to support older Minecraft: Pocket Edition versions with enhanced performance and features. along with bugfixes and experimental infinite world generation. Each loaded world takes ‚àº 20Mbs of Ram (infinite worlds). We recommend using a world unloader plugin to ensure optimal performance.

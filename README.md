## **About Ulticore**  

**Ulticore** is a modernized fork of **Scaxe-Legacy** (itself derived from *NostalgiaCore*, originally based on *PocketMine-MP 1.3.12*), rebuilt to deliver **enhanced performance, stability, and features** for *Minecraft: Pocket Edition Alpha* servers.  

### **Built for a Smooth, Stable Experience**  
While rooted in classic MCPE server software, Ulticore introduces:  
- **Critical bug fixes** ‚Äì Addressing long-standing crashes and gameplay issues from abandoned predecessors.  
- **Experimental infinite worlds** ‚Äì Support for expansive terrain generation (‚âà20MB RAM per loaded world).  
- **Performance optimizations** ‚Äì Reduced lag, smarter entity handling, and efficient chunk management.
- **New Commands** - Commands such as /oplist and /tick have been added. 

### **Key Improvements Over Legacy Forks**  
| Feature          | Old Forks (e.g., NostalgiaCore) | **Ulticore** |  
|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|  
| **World Size**   | Limited/finite                | **Pseudo Infinite** |  
| **RAM Usage**    | Unoptimized (high per-world)  | **~20MB/ loaded world** (efficient) |  
| **Stability**    | Frequent crashes              | **Patched exploits & memory leaks** |  
| **Plugin Support** | Fragmented APIs              | **Backward-compatible + new tools** |
| **Network Packets** | Slow IO              | **Asynchronous network I/O** |
| **Tick Processing** | Slow tick processor              | **Improved tick performance** |

### **Optimization Recommendations**  
For best performance:  
- Use the [**world unloader plugin**](https://github.com/Ulticore-Project/ulticore-plugins/blob/main/worldunloader.php) to free RAM from inactive worlds.  
- Limit concurrent infinite worlds (each consumes ‚âà20MB).  
- Allocate **‚â•256MB RAM** for small servers, **1024MB** for larger servers.  

### **Why This Matters**  
Ulticore bridges the gap between *old MCPE‚Äôs charm* and *modern server demands*‚Äîoffering:  

üîπ **Nostalgia**: Faithful gameplay for Alpha 0.8.X.  
üîπ **Innovation**: Experimental features like infinite worlds.  
üîπ **Longevity**: A maintained codebase where older forks stagnated.  

**Target Versions**: Primarily *MCPE Alpha 0.8.1*.  

---

### **Technical Footnotes**  
- **RAM Usage**: Lower than predecessors but scales with player count/entities.  
- **Compatibility**: Retains most *PocketMine-MP 1.3.12* plugin APIs while adding new extensions.

## **Why Choose Ulticore?**  

### **A Solution to Fragmentation**  
The Minecraft Pocket Edition Alpha 0.8.1 ecosystem has long suffered from **community fragmentation**. Lots of abandoned server forks, incompatible plugins, and unstable builds have made it difficult for players and developers to maintain a consistent multiplayer experience.  

**Ulticore was born in response.**  

### **Our Goal**  
Ulticore is designed to be the **definitive server software** for MCPE Alpha 0.8.1, unifying the scattered landscape of older forks and plugins under one stable, extensible platform.  

We aim to:   **Replace abandoned and outdated forks** ‚Äì No more digging through broken, unsupported codebases.   **Standardize plugin development** ‚Äì A single, well-documented API for all plugins.   **Revive the MCPE 0.8.1 multiplayer scene** ‚Äì By providing a reliable, feature-rich server for new and old communities alike.  

### **History & Vision**  
Originally inspired by the limitations of early MCPE server software, Ulticore was forked from Scaxe-Legacy to:  
- **Improve stability** ‚Äì Fewer crashes, better memory management, and smoother gameplay.  
- **Support modern tooling** ‚Äì Easier setup, better configuration, and compatibility with current dev tools.  
- **Encourage collaboration** ‚Äì Instead of competing forks, we want one **community-driven** project that evolves over time.  

### **One Ecosystem for All**  
Ulticore isn‚Äôt just another fork‚Äîit‚Äôs a **fresh start** for MCPE Alpha 0.8.1 servers. By consolidating the best features from past projects and adding new improvements, we‚Äôre creating a **long-term foundation** for:  
üîπ **Server owners** ‚Äì A hassle-free way to host 0.8.1 worlds with minimal setup.  
üîπ **Plugin developers** ‚Äì A stable API that doesn‚Äôt break between updates.  
üîπ **Players** ‚Äì A consistent, lag-free experience with active support.
